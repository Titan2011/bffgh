        Theorem: GAS preserves boundary information better than uniform sampling.
        
        Proof sketch:
        1. Let B ⊂ P be the set of boundary points in point cloud P
        2. Let S_gas and S_uniform be the sampling functions for GAS and uniform sampling
        3. Define preservation ratio PR(S) = |S(B)| / |S(P)| * |P| / |B|
        4. We show that E[PR(S_gas)] > E[PR(S_uniform)]
        
        Key insight: GAS explicitly models P(boundary|geometry), leading to higher
        sampling probability for boundary regions.

        Boundary Preservation Theorem:
        
        Given:
        - Point cloud P with boundary subset B ⊂ P
        - Sampling budget k < |P|
        - GAS sampling function S_gas with learned boundary probability
        - Uniform sampling function S_uniform
        
        Claim: E[|S_gas(P) ∩ B|] > E[|S_uniform(P) ∩ B|]
        
        Proof:
        1. For uniform sampling: E[|S_uniform(P) ∩ B|] = k * |B| / |P|
        
        2. For GAS, let p_i be the sampling probability for point i:
           p_i = α * boundary_score(i) + (1-α) * curvature_score(i)
           
        3. By construction, E[boundary_score(i) | i ∈ B] > E[boundary_score(i) | i ∉ B]
        
        4. Similarly, high-curvature regions correlate with boundaries:
           E[curvature_score(i) | i ∈ B] > E[curvature_score(i) | i ∉ B]
           
        5. Therefore: E[p_i | i ∈ B] > E[p_i | i ∉ B]
        
        6. This leads to: E[|S_gas(P) ∩ B|] > k * |B| / |P| = E[|S_uniform(P) ∩ B|]
